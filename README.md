### 🚀 About Me

🌱 I am a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering** program and I'm currently revamping my GitHub profile to make it stand out in my job search journey.

💡 I started this path because I believe in using technology to solve real-world problems that matter. I’m passionate about building meaningful software solutions, especially in areas that affect my community — like mental health, education, and youth empowerment.

🎯 My aim is to **become a well-rounded software engineer** who not only codes but also creates impact. That's why I’m interested in working on:
- 🔹 Full-stack web applications
- 🔹 Mobile apps that solve social challenges
- 🔹 Open source tools that make learning or working easier

### 💼 What I’m Working On
- A **Skill-bartering app** that helps unemployed youth exchange skills.
- Personal mini-projects to master frontend and backend development.
- Learning **JavaScript**, **Python**, **React**, and **Databases**.
